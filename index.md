This is a place for Dr. Bill Adams to post some of his current and past work.

# Programming and Mathematics

* [pyanp](https://github.com/wjladams/pyanp): An open source Analytic Network Process (ANP)
and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) library and environment designed by me.
* [SimpleAHP Webapp](http://bamath.org/shiny/simpleahp) and [source code](https://github.com/wjladams/simpleahp): An open source R-Shiny web application for performing a simplified AHP
process.
* [Madden 2016 Machine Learning](https://github.com/dlens/MaddenClustering): A fun project that myself and Gavin Byrnes worked on for Decision Lens.  Essentially analyzing player data on Madden 2016 using clustering techniques and other ideas to discover different player types without a priori knowledge of those types.
* [Game of life continuous version](https://wjladams.github.io/golcontinuous/jsgolcont/main.html) and [source code](https://github.com/wjladams/golcontinuous): A very simple little javascript application that has a continous version of Conway's Game of Life rule set.  If anyone is interested in doing more, please let me know and I'll be happy to play.
* [SuperDecisions](http://superdecisions.com): I was the initial designer, architect, programmer and mathematician of the SuperDecisions application while working for the Creative Decisions Foundation (starting in 1998).  Since 2015 Dr. Elena Rokou has taken over the management of that application.

# Montessori Mathematics
Since 2016, I have volunteered at my children's Montessori school, teaching
mathematics in the Adolescent program.  Here are some interesting links around
that work:
